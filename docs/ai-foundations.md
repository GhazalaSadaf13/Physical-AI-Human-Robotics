# AI Foundations for Robotics

This chapter lays the groundwork for understanding the core AI principles that power modern robotics. We will explore the essential concepts that enable robots to perceive their environment, make intelligent decisions, and take meaningful actions.

### Key Topics Covered:

*   **Machine Learning in Robotics:** An overview of how machine learning algorithms, including supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning, are used to train robots for various tasks.
*   **Neural Networks and Deep Learning:** A deep dive into the architectures of neural networks and their role in enabling robots to learn from complex data, such as images and sensor readings.
*   **Computer Vision:** The techniques that allow robots to "see" and interpret the world around them, including object detection, recognition, and scene understanding.
*   **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** An introduction to how robots process and understand human language, enabling them to follow commands, answer questions, and interact with people naturally.
*   **State Estimation and Localization:** The methods robots use to determine their position and orientation within an environment, a critical component for autonomous navigation.

By the end of this chapter, you will have a solid understanding of the AI foundations that are essential for building and working with intelligent robotic systems. This knowledge will serve as a springboard for the more advanced topics covered later in this book.
